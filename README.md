## About

This repository serves as a personal collection of my work and study materials as I explore the world of data science using Python. The primary focus is on learning and implementing fundamental libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following categories:

### Jupyter Notebooks

A collection of notebooks that demonstrate the usage of various Python libraries for data analysis and visualization.

-   `numpy and its functions.ipynb`: Exploring the fundamentals of NumPy.
-   `pandas and its functions.ipynb`: Hands-on examples with the Pandas library.
-   `matplotlib.ipynb`: Visualizing data using Matplotlib.
-   `seaborn.ipynb`: Advanced data visualization with Seaborn.

### Datasets

The datasets used in the notebooks for analysis and practice.

-   `mercedesbenz.csv`: A dataset for exploring vehicle data.
-   `mydata.csv`: A general-purpose dataset for practice.

### Images

Images and plots generated from the notebooks.

-   `test1.png`: Example plot 1.
-   `test2.png`: Example plot 2.

## Dependencies

The notebooks in this repository rely on the following Python libraries:

-   [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
-   [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
-   [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
-   [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
-   [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn jupyter
```

## Usage

To explore the notebooks, you can clone this repository and run Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Python-Learnings.git
cd Python-Learnings
jupyter notebook
```

This will open a new tab in your web browser where you can navigate to the notebooks and run them.
