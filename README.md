## About

This repository serves as a personal collection of my work and study materials as I explore the world of data science using Python. The primary focus is on learning and implementing fundamental libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following categories:

### Jupyter Notebooks

A collection of notebooks that demonstrate the usage of various Python libraries for data analysis and visualization.

- `eda.ipynb`: Exploratory Data Analysis on various datasets.
- `function.ipynb`: Introduction to Python functions.
- `maping functions.ipynb`: Notebook on mapping functions.
- `numpy and its functions.ipynb`: Exploring the fundamentals of NumPy.
- `pandas and its functions.ipynb`: Hands-on examples with the Pandas library.
- `matplotlib.ipynb`: Visualizing data using Matplotlib.
- `seaborn.ipynb`: Advanced data visualization with Seaborn.

### Datasets

The datasets used in the notebooks for analysis and practice.

- `mercedesbenz.csv`: A dataset for exploring vehicle data.
- `mydata.csv`: A general-purpose dataset for practice.
- `gender_submission.csv`: Titanic competition submission file.
- `titanic_test.csv`: Titanic competition test data.
- `titanic_train.csv`: Titanic competition training data.

### Images

Images and plots generated from the notebooks.

- `test1.png`: Example plot 1.
- `test2.png`: Example plot 2.

## Topics Covered

-   **Data Manipulation and Analysis:**
    -   NumPy: Numerical operations, array manipulation.
    -   Pandas: DataFrames, data cleaning, manipulation, and analysis.
-   **Data Visualization:**
    -   Matplotlib: Creating a wide range of static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
    -   Seaborn: High-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.
-   **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
    -   Applying statistical techniques and visualizations to understand datasets.
-   **Python Fundamentals:**
    -   Functions and mapping functions.

## Dependencies

The notebooks in this repository rely on the following Python libraries:

- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
- [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn jupyter
```

## Usage

To explore the notebooks, you can clone this repository and run Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Python-Learnings.git
cd Python-Learnings
jupyter notebook
```

This will open a new tab in your web browser where you can navigate to the notebooks and run them.
